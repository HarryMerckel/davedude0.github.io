## KEITH

KEITH is a Raspberry Pi powered robot, first conceived around July 2014. He started off as a Pi, a PiRoCon Motor Control Board, a battery and a few motors on a Tamiya base plate and set of tracks.

Since then, KEITH has evolved to have a custom laser cut chassis (designed by Andy Merckel), an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, a pair of homemade wheel encoders, a set of reflectance sensors for line following, LOTS of LEDs and a decorative but functional set of circuitry tracks running down each mudguard. Have a look at the gallery!

We spent a lot of time planning and production took a while, but it was worth it when, at Pi Wars in Cambridge, we won the overall third places for the over Â£75 and autonomous robot categories!

A new robot, KEITH Evolution is currently under development to compete in PiWars 2015. A blog following our progress is <a href="/KEITH-Evo/"><b>here</b></a>.

## The website
This website is powered by Jekyll, a blogging system that creates static HTML files from code and text content. This website uses the <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a> layout. I'm running this website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which processes the Jekyll markdown automatically.
