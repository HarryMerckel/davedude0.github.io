## KEITH
KEITH is a Raspberry Pi powered robot, first conceived around July 2014. He started off as a Pi, a PiRoCon Motor Control Board, a battery and a few motors on a Tamiya base plate and set of tracks.<br/><br/>
Since then, KEITH has evolved to have a custom laser cut chassis (designed by Andy Merckel), an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, a pair of homemade wheel encoders, a set of reflectance sensors for line following, LOTS of LEDs and a decorative but functional set of circuitry tracks running down each mudguard. Have a look at the gallery!<br/><br/>
It took a huge amount of planning and production took a while, but it was worth it when, at Pi Wars in Cambridge, we won the overall third places for the over Â£75 and autonomous robot categories!

## The website
This blog is powered by Jekyll, a brilliant blogging system that creates static HTML files from simple text content. It's fully customisable, and this runs on the <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a> layout, which in turn uses <a href="http://getpoole.com/">Poole</a>. I'm running this website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which nicely features Jekyll support by default - a free and easy hosting system for my needs!
