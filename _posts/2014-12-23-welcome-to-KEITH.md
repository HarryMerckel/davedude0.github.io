title: Welcome to my new website, a blog about K.E.I.T.H. the robot and everything else related!
categories: [KEITH, sticky]

This blog is powered by Jekyll, a brilliant blogging system that creates static HTML files from your simple text content. It's fully customisable, and this runs on the <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a> layout, which in turn uses <a href="http://getpoole.com/">Poole</a>. I'm running this website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which nicely features Jekyll support by default - a free and easy hosting system for my needs!

### What will you see here?

Anything end everything to do with K.E.I.T.H. and any other projects that I'm working on, such as...

* Future K.E.I.T.H. iterations
* The past development of K.E.I.T.H
* Anything interesting I do with the Raspberry Pi
* I will be releasing all the code used with K.E.I.T.H. on my main <a href="github.com/davedude0/">GitHub Page</a>
* Future robotics or automation, using things like the Arduino
