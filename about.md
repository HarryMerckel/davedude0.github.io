## KEITH

KEITH is a Raspberry Pi powered robot, first conceived around July 2014. He started off as a Pi, a PiRoCon Motor Control Board, a battery and a few motors on a Tamiya base plate and set of tracks.

KEITH then evolved to have a custom laser cut chassis (designed by Andy Merckel), an ultrasonic distance sensor, a pair of homemade wheel encoders, a set of reflectance sensors for line following, LOTS of LEDs and a decorative but functional set of circuitry tracks running down each mudguard. Have a look at the gallery!

We spent a lot of time planning the first KEITH and production took a while, but it was worth it when, at Pi Wars in Cambridge, we won the overall third places for the over Â£75 and autonomous robot categories!

For PiWars 2015 we developed a new robot, bigger and better in many ways than last year's - KEITH Evolution. You can see how we made KEITH Evo and how we got on in the competition (Very well!) <a href="/KEITH-Evo/"><b>here</b></a>.

## The website

This website is powered by Jekyll, a blogging system that creates static HTML files from code and text content, and using the <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a> layout. I'm hosting this website using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, which processes the Jekyll markdown automatically and is completely free for everyone.
