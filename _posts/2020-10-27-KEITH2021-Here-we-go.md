For those who don't know us, our PiWars team is a father/son combo, Andy and Harry. We entered Piwars in 2014 when Harry was a keen but inexperienced 15yr old coder with a home-brewed robot called KEITH (Kinetic Electronic Interactive Tracked Hardware). Having had a huge amount of fun and some success we entered again in 2015 with KEITH Evo, a larger and much better built robot. We won the 'A4' size category coming second overall to the 'A3' winner and legend that is Brian Corteil. the 2017 competition was contested using KEITH 3 (Mostly Harmless). A good looking beast, KEITH 3 didn't perform so successfully despite being stronger, faster etc. Clearly the competition had stepped up! 

Harry then went off to university to study Control & Systems Engineering. As a result, the 2018 and 2019 competitions passed without a return of KEITH. Harry got invloved with a team of other roboteers and they gained an entry to PiWars 2020 with a new robot. As his dad, I thought I had got clean away other than a bit of driving and I volunteered to be a marshal/judge so I could watch the team perform from afar.

As everyone knows, a virus arrived and properly messed things up. So when our wonderful PiWars organisers decided to take things into a more virtual world for March 2021 with 'PiWars at Home' Harry promptly entered. My role has promptly gone back to being the spanner-man and anything that does not involve coding or complicated maths...

There was then much discussion about what approach to take:
- We have time(!)
- Harry has knowledge.
- Harry has a 3d printer.
- I have DIY tools.
- We don't have access to a laser cutter.
- We're both working (Harry on a year in industry, working from home most of the time) so no exam pressures, for once.
          
We knew we didn't want to use a commercial robot chassis so, after much soul-searching, we decided to update, up-cycle, re-purpose and otherwise sacrifice our prize-winning robot from PiWars 2015, KEITH Evo.
