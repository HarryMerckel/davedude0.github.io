We've had a good day pulling the last pieces of KEITH 3 together and were happily testing connections to gpio pins. Harry asked me to short out a resistor on one circuit and I touched a wire to something else... A puff of the old magic smoke and some unprogrammed flashing of LEDs ensued before I killed the power. we extracted the Pi and Harry checked a few things and declared it deceased.

A quick on-line hunt and we found that our Amazon Prime membership meant we could get a new one within three hours! Back to testing in the morning...
