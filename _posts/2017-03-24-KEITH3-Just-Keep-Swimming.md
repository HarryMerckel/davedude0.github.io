The new Pi arrived and was fitted, but we had no power to one motor and the other only direction. KEITH Evo used the same chips so we did some comparisons of resistance across connections and discovered that our new chips were not working. so, deep breath and we ordered new ones. They arrived today so we spent the evening removing the old ones and putting the new ones into the circuit. We've tested most of everything else now, so we'll plug everything back together tomorrow and see what happens. If all else fails then KEITH Evo may need to come out of retirement!

I have finished the chassis of the robot. I tweeted a sneaky peek and was suprised at the comments and numbers of likes it attracted.
