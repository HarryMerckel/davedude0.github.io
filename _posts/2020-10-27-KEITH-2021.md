So, Harry goes off to university, gets involved with a team of other roboteers and gains an entry to PiWars 2020. As his dad, I thought I had got clean away other than a bit of driving and I volunteered to be a marshal/judge so I could watch the team perform from afar.
As everyone knows, a virus arrived and properly messed things up so when our wonderful PiWars organisers decided to take things into a more virtual world for March 2021 with 'PiWars at Home' Harry promptly entered. My role has promptly gone back to being the spanner-man and anything that does not involve coding or complicated maths...

There was then much discussion about what approach to take:
- We have time(!)
- Harry has knowledge.
- Harry has a 3d printer.
- I have DIY tools.
- We don't have access to a laser cutter.
- We're both working (Harry on a year in industry, working from home most of the time) so no exam pressures, for once.
          
We knew we didn't want to use a commercial robot chassis so, after much soul-searching, we decided to update, up-cycle, re-purpose and otherwise sacrifice our prize-winning robot from PiWars 2015, KEITH Evo.
